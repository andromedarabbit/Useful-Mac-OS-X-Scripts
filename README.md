# Introduction
This is my personal little open-source project. The plan is to keep the scripts which are useful for Mac OS X users. There is no other special rules but I have some principles:

* Easy to use.
* Integration with [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/).

#  Prerequisites
There are two kinds of scripts for now.

* For Bash scripts, you do not need to install anything. Mac OS X comes with everything you need.
* For scripts written in Javascript, you should install [node js](http://nodejs.org), [npm](https://npmjs.org/), some of modules for node js through npm:

	* [ShellJS for node js](https://github.com/arturadib/shelljs)

[Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) is one of the commercial versions of [Spotlight](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2531). You can use Alfred when you want to access the app that you want to run. Fortunately, you do not have to pay a penny if you do not need other great features which are only available for the paid users.

Anyway, there are a few steps you must take if you want to execute scripts through Alfred. First of all, add the root folder in 'Search Scope':

Done? Then click **Advanced** button:

Be patient! This is the final step. Click '+' button and choose a file with extension `.command`, the you will see **Terminal shell script** like:

Now you can run all the little scripts through Alfred!
